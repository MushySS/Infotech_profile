            <h2>My Name is Mussab Syed, and I am a student at RMIT</h2>
            <p>Mussab Syed. I am 20 years old and currently studying IT at RMIT university. I am of Pakistani descent; born in Australian. I am capable of speaking Urdu/Hindi, although I am not as proficient in them as I am in English. A fact people may find interesting about me would be that I am an E-Sports enthusiast. I watch and take part in E-Sports just as much if not more than the average sports fan.</p>

            <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
            <p>Ever since I was a child, computers were my go-to source of enjoyment. Our family owned a computer long before we had a TV, so PC games would always occupy my day. Soon that love for playing games developed into an obsession. As a child, I would always come up with exciting ideas for new games. Chasing those dreams of one day being a part of dev team for a game that would give as much joy as the games I played gave me.</p>

            <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
            <p>It shouldnâ€™t come as a surprise that my ideal job is a game developer. Game developers work in teams to design, create and publish video games for computers, consoles and/or mobile devices. Their responsibility varies from implementing graphics to writing the code for the functional aspects of the game. Achieving my childhood dream and being able to develop my own games would require certain skills that I would need to acquire. The skills include:</p>

				<ul>
				  <li>Knowledge and Understanding of game engine like Unreal Engine 4 or Unity.</li>
				  <li>Proficiency in C# or similar programming languages.</li>
				  <li>Experience in low-level graphics APIs </li>
				  <li>Experience in full-cycle game design.</li>
				</ul> 
				<p>Currently my experience in the game development industry is limited to just playing the games and the ability to understand java programming. To gain the skills I need to break into the industry a university education in IT is required. To gain experience in the use of game engine to develop games I would need to start using said engines and by creating small indie games. Creating my own small games would prove helpful in learning the engines while also increasing proficiency in C#. Experience in low-level graphic APIs and full-cycle game design would come from group projects and/or other extra-curricular activity to create games or other It projects.</p>

            <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
            <p>The Myers & Briggs' 16 Personality Test is a test created around the 16 personalities created by Isabel Myers and Katharine Briggs, developers of the MBTI assessment. The results indicate that I am an assertive logician. Assertive logicians are often inventive and creative. They often take unusual approaches to satisfy their creative nature.</p>
			<p>According to the learning style test, my preferred learning style would be auditory learning. Which means I am more likely to learn when I can hear the information aloud. Additionally, I am more likely to forget information when there are auditory disturbances. In the Big Five factors test I scored highly on openness and agreeableness. Which indicates that I am creative in my approach and have a willingness to work with others and consider their priorities.</p>
			<p>Working in a group environment requires the ability to solve a multitude of problems. Creativity is required to find the solutions to such problems. The personality tests all indicate my preference to take inventive measure due to my creative mindset. Working in a team environment it can be valuable to have team member that are willing to be creative to solve their problems.  </p>

    	<h1>Chess Editor Tool</h1>

            <h2>A chess tool to create levels with custom pieces, boards, rules, etc.</h2>
            <p>Chess is a game which can be understood in minutes but take decades to master. It is unapologetically the game it was when it was invented in the 6th century. However, I would like to change that and create a tool in which user can change the game fundamentally. This tool would allow users to create new boards of varied sizes and shapes, pieces that follow new rules and move differently and create new rules and completely charge the dynamics of the game. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="col col-mid">
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>Chess has become extremely popular in the gaming community as a virtue of being streamed on a popular streaming service known as Twitch. Due to its recently popularity in the gaming community, there was a lot of talks about the unchanging nature of chess. The board is always setup the same way and the pieces are positioned in the same orientation and perform the same movements. The game of chess seems remarkably interesting, and the changing of its rules brings about exciting new possibilities. Instead of just creating a variant of chess, 
			I would like to create a tool in which users can actively change rule sets, boards and even create new pieces that follow new movements.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="col">
            <h2>Project Description</h2>
			<p>The chess editor tool will allow user to create their own rule set for chess. This means that user will be able to change the rules of the game in the editor and then the editor will allow the user to play with those rule sets. Some of the features the editor would need are: </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Change the amount of chess pieces.</li>
				  <li>Change the shape and size of the board.</li>
				  <li>Add new pieces will new rules.</li>
				  <li>Restrict current rules.</li>
				  <li>Work functionally the same as  a normal chess application.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>The chess editor would firstly need a robust chess application built within it as the user needs to be able to play a game of chess with the new rules. The code for the chess application would also need to be flexible around the ability to change the rule set. Adding the ability to changing the amount of chess pieces would be the easiest hurdle of the development process. However, being able to change the rule set and adding new pieces with new rules would require an algorithm that can take the new rules and change the code for the chess pieces retroactively.</p>
			<p>Creating such an application would be suitable for the Unity engine. Some understanding of graphics design and amazing proficiency in C#. The experience of creating chess and an understanding of algorithms. For now, creating such an application with such complexity is not feasible. This would require full time work and at least an intermediate understanding of C# and the unity engine.</p>
			<p>If this project were to succeed, it would bring a lot of user to the game of chess and it would give these users the ability to create new and creative forms of chess. This editor could also spur on new form of chess competitions and introduce the world to endless ways to play chess.</p>
